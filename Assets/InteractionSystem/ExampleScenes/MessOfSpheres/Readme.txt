This is a moderately more complicated scene where objects have multiple types of interactions
and the sound system is displayed

Clicking the uncolored sphere makes it move and if it bumps into another sphere or a wall spawns a different sphere that when clicked plays a sound

the back boxes play background music and the right flying box resets the scene
